I started this project to learn about MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) operations. Throughout the process, I've gained insights into various concepts and operations. Even though the project may appear straightforward, it involves a lot of valuable learning experiences.

This is an event application built with Next.js 14, a full-stack platform that manages events. It covers CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), includes payment features, user authentication, form handling and validations, mongoose configurations, server actions & routes, and more.
